Playing around with the Twitter API using C.

Probably useless to everyone but me, but I wanted to try out libxml and libcurl.

Uses libcurl to download a user's public Twitter "timeline" as XML.

Uses libxml to parse it.

To build:
   make

To run:
   ./twits <username> <number>

Example:
   ./twits jl_2

Defaults to downloading 10 of my (jl_2) tweets.
